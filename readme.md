# Teacher Cascade Evaluation
This repository contains the code and resources for the "Teacher Cascade Evaluation" system, which is designed to evaluate teacher competence based on our data-driven cascaded Neural Network model. More details can be found in our paper: "Constructing Academic Collaboration Graphs for Teacher Performance Analysis with GCN".

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.8
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, pytorch etc.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/SVIL2024/GCN-Threshold-graph-teacherEval.git

## Usage
open the main_XXX.py or gcn_vs_ml_comparison.py file, and run this file with python main_XXX.py/ gcn_vs_ml_comparison.py

## Dataset
To be more specific, the information gathered from an university is systematically saved in a file named teacher_info***.csv, ensuring its easy access and management for further reference and analysis.
